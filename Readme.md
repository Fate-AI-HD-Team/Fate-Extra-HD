Heyas, D3TR4KT1K here! First update of the texture pack and... is just the ReadMe. Let me explain what's going on. I don't know if you followed any of this since I created the Team and forked the 2020 repository from EmiyaBestBoy, which was the latest fork updated from the Ezehokadrim original repository project, left in 2017. If you don't understand why we didn't added any update the texture pack since June 2022, read below:
 
Fate AI HD Team - We are a small group in different timezones and languages, working at the same time in 2 Texture packs projects from 2 consoles (UC has a PS2 version with the half alpha and 4/3 complication) learning and improving ON THE GO.

We are not related to Iwakura Prods and their work in Fate Extra CCC Translation, but there's a texture pack for Fate Extra CCC which is based on our initial AI Upscale code (thanks for info Fox). 

# Contributing - (Actually looking for people interested to join us)
None of us are artists, our reference is improve what is there, using upscaling algorithms to get decent looking upscales. The goal for now is improve even more the algorithm (Demon and Amakusa) to make the amount of manual postfix required lower possible. Any feedback is welcome, so:
- For those interested in collaborate in the texture pack: [AI Upscale tools Discord](https://discord.gg/dC8SZSxwWS)
- [PPSSPP Discord](https://discord.gg/5NJB6dD)

# Original Description down below (not edited from fork)
# Description
This project intends to deliver a full texture pack for *Fate/Extra* on PSP. It is not intended to look professional, but will attempt look fairly polished. This texture pack is meant to be approximately 1080p quality textures (the PSP resolution makes having exactly 1080P a chore) which means everything is 4 times their original size.

# Installation
The texture pack is meant to be used with the *PPSSPP* emulator. This is the procedure to apply this texture pack:
* Get the Emulator. It is available [here](http://www.ppsspp.org/).
  * Regardless of using the zip/installer version, make sure you know where it is installed. The location will be important later.
* Get a copy of the US release of the game.
  * No link can be provided here, as you should dump it yourself using a copy you physically own.
* Go to *PPSSPP*'s installation folder.
  * If there is no MemStick folder, run the emulator once.
* Go to the MemStick/PSP folder, and create a TEXTURES folder.
  * In this newly created folder, create one called ULUS10576 (which is the game's ID).
* Download this repository using the Clone or Download option, and download as a Zip file.
* Extract the contents of the zip file to the ULUS10576 folder so that textures.ini is in the root of the folder.
* Boot the game in the emulator, and activate texture replacement.
  * This option should be enabled by default, but if it is not the case, it is under Tools>Developer tools>Replace textures

# Credits
All these textures are modifications of the originals, except most of the HUD elements, which I remade myself and some other miscellaneous textures. I do not own any of the original textures, credit goes to the trademark/copyright holders. As for my work, I would like credit (simply mentioning my username is enough) if you do use them.
