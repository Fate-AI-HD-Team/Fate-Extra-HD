Heyas, D3TR4KT1K here! Second update (wow, already Jan 2024) of the texture pack and... few changes are done. Chunk system is problematic to editing, merge, scale, tile again and rename, so, process is slow.  Here's a temporary screenshot of the update:

Rooftop view - Temp reason is, sometimes doors are messed.

# Contributing - (Actually looking for people interested to join us)
None of us are artists, our reference is improve what is there, using upscaling algorithms to get decent looking upscales. The goal for now is improve even more the algorithm (Demon and Amakusa) to make the amount of manual postfix required lower possible. Any feedback is welcome, so:

# Original Description down below (not edited from fork)
# Description
This project intends to deliver a full texture pack for *Fate/Extra* on PSP. It is not intended to look professional, but will attempt look fairly polished. This texture pack is meant to be approximately 1080p quality textures (the PSP resolution makes having exactly 1080P a chore) which means everything is 4 times their original size.

# Installation
The texture pack is meant to be used with the *PPSSPP* emulator. This is the procedure to apply this texture pack:
* Get the Emulator. It is available [here](http://www.ppsspp.org/).
  * Regardless of using the zip/installer version, make sure you know where it is installed. The location will be important later.
* Get a copy of the US release of the game.
  * No link can be provided here, as you should dump it yourself using a copy you physically own.
* Go to *PPSSPP*'s installation folder.
  * If there is no MemStick folder, run the emulator once.
* Go to the MemStick/PSP folder, and create a TEXTURES folder.
  * In this newly created folder, create one called ULUS10576 (which is the game's ID).
* Download this repository using the Clone or Download option, and download as a Zip file.
* Extract the contents of the zip file to the ULUS10576 folder so that textures.ini is in the root of the folder.
* Boot the game in the emulator, and activate texture replacement.
  * This option should be enabled by default, but if it is not the case, it is under Tools>Developer tools>Replace textures

# Credits
All these textures are modifications of the originals, except most of the HUD elements, which I remade myself and some other miscellaneous textures. I do not own any of the original textures, credit goes to the trademark/copyright holders. As for my work, I would like credit (simply mentioning my username is enough) if you do use them.
